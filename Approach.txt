For the Challenge I have used Python as the Main Programming Language, PyTorch to process the Images and Extract The Features and Annoy to retrieve the Neighbours based on Image Features

Processing The Images : 

I have Created the PyTorch Dataset and DataLoader to acess the Images and used VGG19 pretrained model to extract features from Images.
Used PyTorch Hooks to extract Features from Intermediate layers

Retrieving Neighbours : 

I have Built the Annoy Tree using the features extracted from VGG19 and added scripts to retrieve neighbours based on index, feature vector or Input Image

Clustering The Images : 

To CLuster the Images i have used the features extracted from VGG19 model and reduced them to 2 dimensional using TSNE and apllied KMeans clustering on top of reduced features
