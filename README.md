# Avantari-ML-Challenge
Retrieving Similar Images from a single Image

# Problem Statement
You are provided with a dataset of ~5k 512x512 images, your program should accept an
512x512 input image and return N images from the provided dataset similar to the input image.

## Evaluation Method
<p>Your code submission will be evaluated based code quality and on how accurate it is
able to find similar images</p>
<p>  simple score of C/N</p>
<p>   C = no. of correct similar images returned</p>
<p>   N = no. requested images</p>
<p>Plus points, for finding similar images with respect to unique feature</p>
<p>  simple score of F/N</p>
<p>    F = no. of images returned with the unique feature specific to the input image</p>
<p>    N = no. requested images</p>
<p>Bonus points, if the provided dataset was clustered into K groups</p>
<p>Quality of Code based on Modularity, Reusability, Maintainability, Readability</p>
